# SubredditLocker

This is a small application I'm putting together specifically for my son, who loves scrolling through reddit.com/r/aww.  Currently, it grabs the top 100 submissions from /r/aww in JSON, then parses and displays them in a collection view.  Animated images are not currently working, but are next on the feature list.
